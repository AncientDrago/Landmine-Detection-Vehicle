## üß≠ Project Overview

This vehicle combines a metal detector circuit with a NodeMCU (ESP8266) to identify metallic objects beneath the surface. It is mounted on a mobile platform capable of navigating terrain and transmitting detection alerts wirelessly. The system is designed to be modular, affordable, and adaptable for real-world deployment.

# üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

## 1. Hardware Assembly
- Mount motors and wheels to the chassis.
- Connect the metal detector output to NodeMCU analog pin (A0).
- Wire the L298N motor driver to the NodeMCU digital pins and motors.
- Add LEDs or a buzzer for detection alerts.

## 2. Firmware Upload
- Open Arduino IDE.
- Install ESP8266 board manager.
- Upload `detection_vehicle.ino` from `firmware/`.

## 3. Power Supply
- Use 12V battery for motors and 5V regulated supply for NodeMCU.
- Ensure common ground between all components.

## 4. Testing
- Place metallic objects under the surface.
- Monitor serial output or LED/buzzer alerts.
