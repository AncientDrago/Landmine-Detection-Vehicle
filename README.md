## 🧭 Project Overview

This vehicle combines a metal detector circuit with a NodeMCU (ESP8266) to identify metallic objects beneath the surface. It is mounted on a mobile platform capable of navigating terrain and transmitting detection alerts wirelessly. The system is designed to be modular, affordable, and adaptable for real-world deployment.
